# Definition

Segments fans into four distinct value categories using percentile thresholds: 'Top Tier' identifies fans with FLV above the 90th percentile (p90), representing the platform's most valuable users; 'High Value' identifies fans with FLV between the 75th and 90th percentiles (p75 to p90); 'Medium Value' identifies fans with FLV between the 50th and 75th percentiles (median to p75); 'Low Value' applies to all fans with FLV below the median (p50). This segmentation enables targeted retention strategies, premium service offerings, and resource allocation based on projected economic contribution.
