# Definition

Water is classified into five quality categories based on its quality index: 'High-Quality' WHEN (waterqualityindex >= 91), suitable for all purposes including direct consumption; 'Good' WHEN (waterqualityindex >= 71 AND waterqualityindex < 91), safe for consumption after standard treatment; 'Moderate' WHEN (waterqualityindex >= 51 AND waterqualityindex < 71), acceptable for washing but not consumption; 'Poor' WHEN (waterqualityindex >= 26 AND waterqualityindex < 51), suitable only for limited non-contact uses; 'Unsafe' WHEN (waterqualityindex < 26), unsuitable for any use and requiring immediate remediation.
